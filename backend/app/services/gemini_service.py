Here is a list of categories for tourist locations. Each category contains an item with a "name" and an "id":

{available_types_dict}

From the following paragraph, extract the following information:
- Up to 10 category names by understanding the user's intent and matching the described places or activities to the "name" values in the categories, even if the wording is not exact.
    - For each match, return the corresponding "name" and set "additional": false.
    - If fewer than 10 names are found, select additional names from the same categories as those already matched, until you have 10 in total. For these, set "additional": true.
- The trip name, start day, end day, and number of people if mentioned.
- Any specific desired destinations if mentioned (e.g. landmarks, attractions).
- A desired starting point if mentioned.

**Date calculation requirements:**  
- If the user provides only a start date or only an end date, automatically calculate the missing date so that the trip duration is at least 2 or 3 days.
    - For example, if the user says "starting from 12th December" and wants a 3-day trip, set start_day to "YYYY-12-12" and end_day to "YYYY-12-14", where YYYY is the **current year (now: {datetime.datetime.now().year})**.
    - If the user says "ending on 15th December" and wants a 3-day trip, set end_day to "YYYY-12-15" and start_day to "YYYY-12-13", where YYYY is the **current year (now: {datetime.datetime.now().year})**.
- If the user does not specify any dates, choose a time interval that is 2 or 3 days long, starting about 1 or 2 weeks from the current date, and use the **current year ({datetime.datetime.now().year})**.
- Never set the same value for both start and end date unless the trip is explicitly for one day.

**Validation requirement:**  
If the starting point is not one of the following cities (accepting all common spellings, abbreviations, and Vietnamese tone/case variations): 
- "Ho Chi Minh City", "HCMC", "Saigon", "Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh", "TP.HCM"
- "Da Lat", "Dalat", "Đà Lạt", "đà lạt", "Đà lạt"
- "Hue", "Huế", "huế"
(with or without ', Vietnam'), set a field `valid_starting_point` to `false` and do not generate any plan.  
Otherwise, set `valid_starting_point` to `true` and always format the starting point as '<city>, Vietnam'.
For the field `starting_point`, always return one of the following exact values:
- "HCMC, Vietnam"
- "Dalat, Vietnam"
- "Hue, Vietnam"
Do not use any other spelling, abbreviation, or format. If the city is not one of these, set `valid_starting_point` to `false`.

**Date formatting requirement:**  
For the fields `start_day` and `end_day`, always return dates in ISO format: "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g., "2024-06-10").  
Do not use other formats.

Return the result using this schema:
- trip_info: object with trip_name (str), start_day (str), end_day (str), num_people (int)
- starting_point: str
- desired_destinations: list of str
- valid_starting_point: bool
- categories: list of objects with name (str) and additional (bool)
